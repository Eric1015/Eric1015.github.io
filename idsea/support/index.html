  <h3>How to use</h3>
  <p>In order to make the most out of Idsea, you should create many idea cards which will randomly populated on the top screen.</p>
  <p>More cards means more kinds of combinations. Once the random cards combination shows up in the screen, try to think about the combination and see if you can come up with some interesting idea with them.</p>
  <p>If you figured out an interesting idea, click on "New Idea" to record that as an idea.</p>
  <p>If you were not able to think about anything, no worries, just click on "Shuffle" to get a new combination for another try!</p>
  <p>In the idea cards list page, you can remove any cards that you don't feel useful for you.</p>
  <p>You can also view the list of idea that you have recorded in the application by going to the idea page</p>
  <p>This application is built in a offline-first manner, so you can use this application while on the plane and any other circumstances where you don't have access to the internet if you have signed in already</p>
